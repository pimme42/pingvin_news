This application is dedicated to Pingvin Rugby Club of Trelleborg, Sweden (http://www.pingvin.nu).


My reason for creating this app is mainly to learn more about app developing. 
I have also created a corresponding back-end providing the REST-API using Lumen. 
The code for the back-end is available from https://gitlab.com/pingvin/pingvinapi.

If this code is found somewhere else, the original code is located at https://gitlab.com/pingvin/pingvinapp. 

The code is released under the MIT-license. See LICENSE-file in the root directory for more information.
